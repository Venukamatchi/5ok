Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed. Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.",

Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil. Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices. Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.",
