If the dough is too wet, add more bread flour, about 2 tablespoons at a time (up to 8 tablespoons) to make a workable dough; too much flour can make the dough dry.

Working on a floured surface, roll the small dough pieces into ropes about the thickness of your thumb and about 12 inches long. Ropes should be fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. Pinch 3 ropes together at the top and braid them. Starting with the strand to the right, move it to the left over the middle strand (that strand becomes the new middle strand.) Take the strand farthest to the left, and move it over the new middle strand. Continue braiding, alternating sides each time, until the loaf is braided, and pinch the ends together and fold them underneath for a neat look. Place the loaves onto the prepared baking sheets, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes. Brush a coating of egg glaze onto the tops of the bread, and reserve the remaining glaze.",

Fold top crust under bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edges with foil.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, about 20 minutes more."

    "description": "These little yeast-risen dough puffs are deep-fried to a golden brown, then drizzled with honey syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon. They're popular all around the Mediterranean, especially in Greece, and are beloved as a Hanukkah treat among Sephardic Jews.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast",
      "1 cup warm water",
      "0.5 cup warm milk",
      "0.25 cup white sugar",
      "1 teaspoon salt",

      "4 cups all-purpose flour",
      "0.5 cup honey",
      "0.5 cup water",
      "4 cups vegetable oil, or as needed",
      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. In a large bowl, mix the warm milk, sugar, and salt, and mix to dissolve. Pour the yeast mixture into the milk mixture, and stir to combine.",
      "Beat in the butter, eggs, and flour until the mixture forms a smooth, soft dough. Cover the bowl, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Stir the dough well, cover, and let rise 30 more minutes.",
      "Mix honey and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and let the honey syrup cool.",
      "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil should be about 2 inches deep.",
      "Place a large table or soup spoon in a glass of water near the batter. Scoop up about 2 tablespoons of dough per puff with the wet spoon, drop it into the wet palm of your hand, and roll it back into the spoon to create a round shape. Do not overhandle the puffy, soft dough. Drop the dough balls into the hot oil in batches, wetting the spoon each time you make a dough ball. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown on the bottom, and roll them over to cook the other side, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Gently set the loukoumades aside to drain on paper towels.",
      "Place the loukoumades on a baking sheet, drizzle them with honey syrup, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve warm."
