      "To flip the frittata, place a dinner plate over the pan holding it firmly in place, then turn the frying pan and plate upside down. The frittata will fall into the plate, top side down. Slide the frittata back into the frying pan, top down. Cook for a few minutes until top (now the bottom) is cooked.",
      "Alternately, place the frying pan under a preheated broiler until the top is cooked and slightly puffed, about a minute or two. The frying pan must be ovenproof in order to do this. To ovenproof the handle, wrap it with a double thickness of aluminum foil.",

      "Place the shredded potatoes in a bowl, cover with water, and set aside. Bring the onion, garlic, green chiles, and chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the sauce thickens; turn off the heat.",
      "Meanwhile, place the strips of bacon on paper towels on a microwave-safe plate, and cook on High until crisp, about 1 minute per strip; set aside.",
      "Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Drain the potatoes, and add to the skillet. Spoon hot oil over the potatoes; sprinkle with the onion powder, salt, and pepper. Flip the potatoes occasionally, but let them fry until crispy bits form and the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes.",
      "Place the tortillas between two damp paper towels. Microwave on High until warm, about 30 seconds.",
      "Spray a separate skillet with butter flavored cooking spray and cook the eggs over medium heat, whisking them continuously until the eggs are completely set; turn off the heat.",
      "Lay a tortilla flat in front of you. Place some potatoes, scrambled egg, and a strip of bacon on the lower third, leaving about an inch of room from the bottom, and about 1-1/2 inches on the left and right clear for folding the burrito. Spoon on a little of the green chile sauce, and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.",
      "Fold the left and right edges into the middle about 1-1/2 to 2 inches. Take the bottom edge closest to you with the stuffing and pick it up, pulling it OVER the filling, while keeping the sides in place until that edge now touches the tortilla about 7/8 of the way up to the top edge. Check to see that the sides are still tucked well. If they aren't slide them in a bit now that you have the filling covered. Finish by tucking the bottom flap that you pulled over the filling UNDER the filling a bit to seal it, then continue rolling the burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Let it rest seam-side down, and it will stay nice and tight. Repeat with remaining ingredients."

    "description": "This is a recipe from a cafe in Santa Fe, New Mexico. They are good with maple syrup or, if you're ambitious, with homemade peach or raspberry spread. This recipe serves four people, fewer if they're very hungry.",
    "ingredients": [
      "0.75 cup blue cornmeal",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "1 tablespoon white sugar",
      "1 cup boiling water",

      "2 teaspoons baking powder",
      "0.5 cup pine nuts, toasted"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a medium bowl, mix together the blue cornmeal, salt and sugar. Stir in the boiling water until all of the ingredients are wet. Cover, and let stand for a few minutes.",
      "In a measuring cup, combine the milk, egg and melted butter. Stir the milk mixture into the cornmeal mixture. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the cornmeal mixture until just incorporated. If the batter is stiff, add a little more milk until it flows off the spoon thickly but smoothly.",
      "Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat, and grease it with a dab of oil or butter. Use about 2 tablespoons of batter for each pancake. Quickly sprinkle a few pignoli onto each cake. When the entire surface of the pancakes are covered with bubbles, flip them over, and cook the other side until golden. It's hard to tell when blue food is cooked through--so give them a few extra seconds if you're in doubt.",
      "Serve immediately with maple syrup of fruit preserves."
