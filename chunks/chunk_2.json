After bacon is about halfway cooked, move it to the outside of the pot and set pork chop into the middle of the pot. Cook on each side until lightly browned, about 2 minutes each. Remove pork chop and add chicken thighs, skin side down, and also brown on each side. Browning is optional but it will add more flavor.",

Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes, and stir to deglaze the bottom. Increase heat to high, bring to a simmer, and stir in garlic powder and black pepper.",

Let the pot come back to a simmer (you can raise heat to do this faster, but reduce back to medium-low to maintain a simmer).",
      "Simmer until potatoes are tender, and everything is cooked to your liking, about 30 minutes more. Add water or chicken broth to the pot if it seems like things are getting too thick, but this is a stew, and should be fairly thick. Once done, stir in vinegar. Taste, adjust salt, and serve with green onions."

      "Peel back the skin from the chicken drumsticks and breasts without removing the skin, and make several deep cuts in the chicken meat. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning into the cuts and onto the meat, then replace the skin. Whisk 1/2 cup olive oil and white wine together in a bowl. Place the chicken into a large bowl, pour the olive oil mixture over, stir to coat, and refrigerate 1 hour.",

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet until the oil shimmers, and brown the chicken pieces over medium heat, working in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes per side. Place all the chicken pieces into a large soup pot, and pour the broth over the chicken. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the chicken until tender, about 20 minutes.",

Heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. After about 5 minutes of stirring, the roux will begin to turn a pale golden color, and gently bubble and foam. Stir the roux until it turns the color of milk chocolate and gives off a nutty fragrance, about 30 to 40 more minutes. Watch carefully because it's easy to burn the roux. Pull the pan from the hot burner, and stir until the roux cools and stops cooking, about 5 more minutes.",

Season the gumbo with 2 more teaspoons of Cajun seasoning, or to taste, and bring the soup to a rolling boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour.",

Remove the chicken pieces, and take the chicken meat off the bones, discarding the skin and bones. Return the chicken meat to the soup. Simmer 15 more minutes, and skim off the layer of oil that has formed on top of the gumbo.",

Add water or chicken broth to the pot if it seems like things are getting too thick, but this is a stew, and should be fairly thick. Once done, stir in vinegar.

    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups milk",
      "0.5 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)",
      "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast",
      "1 cup white sugar",
      "4 large eggs, beaten",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "1 teaspoon ground cardamom",
      "9 cups all-purpose flour",
      "0.5 cup butter, melted",
      "1 large egg",
      "1 tablespoon water",
      "2 tablespoons white sugar"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm.",
      "Stir together warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.",
      "Stir lukewarm milk, sugar, 4 beaten eggs, salt, and cardamom into yeast mixture. Beat in 2 cups flour until combined. Add 3 cups flour and beat until dough is smooth and elastic. Add melted butter; beat until glossy. Mix in remaining flour until dough is stiff.",
      "Transfer dough to a floured surface, cover with an inverted mixing bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.",
      "Knead dough until smooth and satiny, then place in a lightly greased mixing bowl and turn dough to coat. Cover with a dish towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough; let rise again until almost doubled, about 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.",
      "Turn dough out again onto a floured surface and divide into 3 equal pieces. Divide each piece into thirds. Roll each piece into a 12- to 16-inch strip. Braid 3 strips into a loaf to get 3 large, braided loaves. Lift loaves onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a dish towel and let rise for 20 minutes.",
      "Beat together 1 egg and water in a small bowl. Brush over loaves and sprinkle with sugar.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Check occasionally because the bottoms of loaves can burn quickly."
